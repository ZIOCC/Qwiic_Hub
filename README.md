#### Description

Want to split your Qwiic [bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_network) into a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_network)? Grab a hub! 

The Zio Qwiic Hub is a simple board with 4 Qwiic connectors in parallel. Just connect your main Qwiic bus to one of those ports, and split it into as many as three chains of modules.

Building a humanoid robotic torso and want to put a servo controller on each arm without creating unnecessary capacitance by running your bus down one arm and back to get to the other? Perfect! Just use the hub to split your bus, and youâ€™re good to go.

The board is easily mountable due to the inclusion of a 3mm mounting hole.
